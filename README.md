Data Analysis and Preprocessing

Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis on a sizable dataset comprising 34,000 instances and 9 features, addressing all missing values to ensure data integrity.
Model Implementation and Accuracy Enhancement

Employed data preprocessing and mining techniques to balance an imbalanced dataset, leading to enhanced model performance. Implemented logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machine models. Concluded that the neural network model achieved the highest accuracy at 83%.
